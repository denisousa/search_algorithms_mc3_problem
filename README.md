## Code

The `code` directory contains the implementations of various search algorithms used to solve the MC3 problem. These algorithms are written in Python and can be executed to find solutions for the problem.

## Datasets

The `datasets` directory contains the datasets used as oracles to validate the solutions generated by the search algorithms.
The data refers to code clones between the Stack Overflow and Qualtias corpus platforms.
In addition, it also has a 'download_links.txt' file that provides download links for Stack Overflow code snippets and Qualitas corpus projects.

## Parameters

In the `parameters` directory, you'll find files containing the values of search spaces used by the algorithms. These files provide the parameters necessary for configuring the search algorithms to explore different solution spaces efficiently.

## Links

The `links.md` file has example clone links between Stack Overflow and the Qualitas corpus

## Computational Infrastructure

The `infrastructure.md` file contains a description of the infrastructure that were used to carry out our experiment.
