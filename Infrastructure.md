# Computational Infrastructure

To run the search algorithms, we used a dedicated desktop computer with an AMD Ryzen 3 PRO 2200G processor with a maximum capacity of 3,500 MHz, 8 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of SSD.
Given the heavy usage of I/O operations by Siamese, we made sure that there were no other applications with memory and disk usage during the experiments.
